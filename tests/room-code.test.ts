 * People paste codes into chat, read them aloud, and type them on a different
 * device through an autocapitalizing keyboard. If "k7qp" and "K7QP" resolve to
 * different Trystero rooms, both players sit in what each believes is the same
 * room, alone, forever — and the UI has nothing to show them that is wrong.
